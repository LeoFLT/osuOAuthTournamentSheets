# osu! 1v1 Tournament OAuth sheets

This collection of scripts will:

* Authorize a player via osu! and Discord OAuth2 services, meaning identity forging is impossible.
* Add the player to a spreadsheet, along with relevant information (Timestamp, user ID, Username, Rank, Avatar, etc.)
* Auto-join your desired Discord server, assignining as many roles as you wish.

# Dependencies
none

WIP but works as is.
