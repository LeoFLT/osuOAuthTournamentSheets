	<br>
	Deploy the script as a Web App via the "Publish > Deploy as a web app..." menu:

	<br>
	Finally, give it a description of your liking, ALWAYS change "Project Version" to "New", then press on the "Update"
	button and copy the URL it gives you.

	<h2>One important thing to note is that you have to repeat this step<br>every time you change the contents of the script files.</h2>
	<div class="list">
		<ul>
			<li>Example 1: You decided to customize your registration<br>process using HTML/CSS frameworks.<br>You need to re-deploy it.</li><br>
			<li>Example 2: After first setting up the sheet,<br>you realise that you want to give an additional role to your players.<br>You need to re-deploy it.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	If you make updates to any project files you will need to re-deploy your project.
	<br>
	<br>
	Now take the URL you saved and click on Set Script Properties

	Paste your link and click 'Ok'. The script will close, this is expected. Open the "Show Instructions" menu once
	again to see the updated instructions.
