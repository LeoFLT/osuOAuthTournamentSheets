  Deploy the script as a Web App via the "Publish > Deploy as a web app..." menu:

	<br>
  Finally, give it a description of your liking, ALWAYS change "Project Version" to "New", then press on the "Update" button and copy the URL it gives you.

  One thing to note is that you have to repeat this first step after you finish following the instructions in this popup (or every time you change a script property, e.g. when you add your osu!/Discord Client ID/secret, change your Tournament Acronym, etc.)
	<br>
	<br>
  Now take the URL you saved and click on Set Script Properties

  Paste your link and click 'Ok'. The script will close, this is expected. Open the "Show Instructions" menu once again to see the updated instructions.
